            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Jia Jun, a Year 1 undergraduate studying at NUS. 
            <br>I'm majoring in Statistics as I'm interested in Probability and Statistics. 
            I'm still in the middle of figuring out a plan on what to study. 
            I'm considering a specialisation in data science to improve my employability after graduation. 
            This should leave me with enough credits to pursue a minor, but I'm currently unsure on what subject I should pursue...</p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I usually read books in my free time, ranging from textbooks to fictional storybooks and occasionally some philosophical works.
                <br>I also do some origami in my free time, but this heavily depends on my mood and usually I only have enough motivation to fold 2 to 3 works in a year.
                <br>I am also a professional yapper.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>
                <br>This website is still mostly work in progress and I will try to include more things inside. I would like to give special thanks to ChatGPT for making 90% of this website!
                <br>I am a beginner at programming and only recently started learning html and css. I will try my best to learn so as to not be too reliant on ChatGPT in the future but for now I'll abuse it as much as I can :D
