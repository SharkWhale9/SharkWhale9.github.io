            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Jia Jun, a Year 1 undergraduate studying at NUS. 
                <br>I'm majoring in Statistics as I'm interested in applied probability and statistics.  
                <br>A specialisation in data science should improve my employability after graduation so I might try pursuing that in Y3.
                <br>I'm thinking of doing a few physics mods too so I might end up getting a minor in physics while I'm at it.
                <br>There's still plenty of time for me to consider my options so none of this is confirmed yet.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Reading</b>: I read a wide range of genres and ranging from textbooks to novels and occasionally some philosophy (<em>not that I understand it very well</em>)
                <br><b>Origami</b>: Sometimes I fold, most of the time I dilly dally. It depends heavily on my mood for motivation and I only fold about 2~3 works a year.
                <br><b>Yapping</b>: Born to Yap, Forced to Shut Up

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                Im currently interested in <em>Applied Probability</em>, particularly in stochastics and bayesian statistics. My ultimate goal is to eventually learn measure theory to deepen my understanding of probability theory, provided that I am willing enough to learn abstract math. 
                I'll probably only consider this after graduation as there is a lot of prerequisite knowledge for me to catch up on.   
                <br>On the side, I'm also interested in learning physics. I personally believe classical mechanics is superior to quantum mechanics but I'm openly to learning more about any branch of physics. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I like listening to music in my free time as it allows me to explore new sounds and audio technology. Over the years, I've invested a bit too much in audio equipment, my favourite being the <em>Moondrop Blessing 3</em>. 
                My favourite band is <b>Linkin Park</b> as their songs resonate with me. Their music capture a wide variety of emotions and explore many themes, allowing everyone to interpret them in a personal way. 
                My favourite song usually depends on how I feel at the period of time but if I had to name one, it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/HNCgBuI2eJc?si=HlGqnj45wvmlBbP6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forgotten</a> from their album <em>Hybrid Theory</em>.
                <br>My interest goes beyond just listening. I've always been fascinated with audio technology and would like to find the correct equipment to enhance my listening experience. I will not elaborate on how much money I've spent on audio equipment.
