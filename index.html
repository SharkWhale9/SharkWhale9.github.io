            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Jia Jun, a Year 1 undergraduate studying at NUS. 
                <br>I'm majoring in Statistics as I'm interested in applied probability and statistics.  
                <br>A specialisation in data science should improve my employability after graduation so I might try pursuing that in Y3.
                <br>I'm thinking of doing a few physics mods too so I might end up getting a minor in physics while I'm at it.
                <br>There's still plenty of time for me to consider my options so none of this is confirmed yet.
            </p>

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                Reading is something I like doing in my free time. The works I read range from textbooks to fictional storybooks and occasionally some philosophical works.
                <br>I also like folding origami in my free time, but this heavily depends on my mood and I usually only have enough motivation to fold 2 to 3 works in a year.
                <br>I'm also a professional yapper.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>
                <br>This website is still mostly work in progress and I will try to include more things inside. I would like to give special thanks to ChatGPT for writing the html code of this website!
                <br>I'm not too sure what I want to put on this website so it shall stay like this for quite some time...
