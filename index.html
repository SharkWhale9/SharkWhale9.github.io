            <h2>About Myself</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Jia Jun, a Year 1 undergraduate studying at NUS. 
            <br>I'm majoring in Statistics as I'm interested in the Proability and Statistics. 
            I'm still in the middle of figuring out a plan on what to study. 
            I'm considering a specialisation in data science to improve my employability after graduation. 
            This should leave me with enough credits to pursue a minor, but I'm currently unsure on what subject I should pursue...</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I usually read books in my free time, ranging from textbooks to fictional storybooks and occasionally some philosophical works.
                <br> I also do some origami in my free time, but this heavily depends on my mood and usually I only have enough motivation to fold 2 to 3 works in a year.
