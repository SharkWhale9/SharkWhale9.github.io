            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Jia Jun, a Year 1 undergraduate studying at NUS. 
                <br>I'm majoring in Statistics as I'm interested in applied probability and statistics.  
                <br>A specialisation in data science should improve my employability after graduation so I might try pursuing that in Y3.
                <br>I'm thinking of doing a few physics mods too so I might end up getting a minor in physics while I'm at it.
                <br>There's still plenty of time for me to consider my options so none of this is confirmed yet.

            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                <b>Reading</b>: I read a wide range of genres, ranging from textbooks to novels and occasionally some philosophy (<em>not that I understand it very well</em>)
                <br><b>Origami</b>: Sometimes I fold, most of the time I dilly dally. It depends heavily on my mood for motivation and I only fold about 2~3 works a year.
                <br><b>Yapping</b>: Born to Yap, Forced to Shut Up

            <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>
                Im currently interested in <em>Applied Probability</em>, with a focus on stochastics and bayesian statistics. My long term goal is to study measure theory to gain a deeper understanding of probability theory, though I'll need to build up my knowledge on analysis first.
                I'll slowly work my way to this goal in the later years of my undergraduate studies. 
                <br>Alongside that, I'm also interested in learning more about physics. I personally believe classical mechanics is superior to quantum mechanics, but I'm open to learning more about any branch of physics that piques my interest. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                I like listening to music in my free time as it allows me to explore new sounds and audio technology. 
                My favourite band is <b>Linkin Park</b> as their songs resonate with me. Their music captures a wide variety of emotions and explore many themes, allowing everyone to interpret them in a personal way. 
                My favourite song usually depends on how I feel at the time but if I had to name one, it would be <a href="https://youtu.be/HNCgBuI2eJc?si=HlGqnj45wvmlBbP6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forgotten</a> from their album <em>Hybrid Theory</em>.
                <br>My interest goes beyond just listening. I've always been fascinated with audio technology and finding the correct equipment to enhance my listening experience. My favourite IEM that I own is the <em>Moondrop Blessing 3</em>. I will not elaborate on how much money I've spent on this hobby.
